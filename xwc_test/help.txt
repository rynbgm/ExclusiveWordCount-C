Usage: xwc [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Exclusive word counting. Print the number of occurrences of each word that appears in one and
only one of given text FILES.

A word is, by default, a maximum length sequence of characters that do not belong to the
white-space characters set.

Results are displayed in columns on the standard output. Columns are separated by the tab
character. Lines are terminated by the end-of-line character. A header line shows the FILE
names: the name of the first FILE appears in the second column, that of the second in the
third, and so on. For the following lines, a word appears in the first column, its number of
occurrences in the FILE in which it appears to the exclusion of all others in the column
associated with the FILE. No tab characters are written on a line after the number of
occurrences.

Read the standard input when no FILE is given or for any FILE which is "-". In such cases, ""
is displayed in the column associated with the FILE on the header line.

The locale specified by the environment affects sort order. Set 'LC_ALL=C' to get the
traditional sort order that uses native byte values.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

Program Information
  -?, --help    Print this help message and exit.

      --usage   Print a short usage message and exit.

      --version    Print version information.

Processing
  -a            Same as --words-processing=avl-binary-tree.

  -h            Same as --words-processing=hash-table.

  -w, --words-processing=TYPE    Process the words according to the data structure specified by
                TYPE. The available values for TYPE are self explanatory: 'avl-binary-tree' and
                'hash-table'. Default is 'hash-table'.

Input Control
  -i, --initial=VALUE    Set the maximal number of significant initial letters for words to
                VALUE. 0 means without limitation. Default is 0.

  -p, --punctuation-like-space    Make the punctuation characters play the same role as
                white-space characters in the meaning of words.

  -r, --restrict=FILE    Limit the counting to the set of words that appear in FILE. FILE is
                displayed in the first column of the header line. If FILE is "-", read words
                from the standard input; in this case, "" is displayed in first column of the
                header line.

Output Control
  -l            Same as --sort=lexicographical.

  -n            Same as --sort=numeric.

  -S            Same as --sort=none.

  -s, --sort=TYPE    Sort the results in ascending order, by default, according to TYPE. The
                available values for TYPE are: 'lexicographical', sort on words, 'numeric',
                sort on number of occurrences, first key, and words, second key, and 'none',
                don't try to sort, take it as it comes. Default is 'none'.

  -R, --reverse    Sort in descending order on the single or first key instead of ascending
                order. This option has no effect if the -S option is enable.
